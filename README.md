Things I'm interested in:

* TypeScript — my precious; just please, _please,_ no browser stuff
* Go — in progress, but happily so
* SPC700 ASM — yes, the SNES audio CPU
* Interacting with web APIs — the bad ones make me shudder in delight
* (De-)serialising binary data structures — couldn't ask for better puzzles
* Learning through dissection — I **WILL** dive into your low-level libraries
* Good food, non-plastic music, books about time loops, the occasional speedrun (perhaps live again some day)
* All the ponies — don't worry, you're cute too

Learning in progress. Always learning. As such, here be ~dragons~ ponies.
