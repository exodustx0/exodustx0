Hi! I am `Exodust`, though my friends call me `Exo`. I only use `x0` as name disambiguation on sites where "Exodust" is taken, preferably stylised with a slashed zero.

"Exodust" is my way of saying: "I'm doing something with these thoughts of mine, rather than letting them decompose." (Hint: my thoughts are the dust.)

As far as coding is concerned, I currently struggle to describe myself as anything other than a mercurial tinkerer; there's simply no direction to it, no real structured way of working to speak of. I'm an entropy pointer, if you will. All that aside, I am well-versed in Go, SPC700 assembly (yes, that's the APU of the Nintendo SNES) and TypeScript (though I really don't care to ever write TS/JS again), and I'm excited to eventually add Rust to that. Personal projects that I've worked on (to various degrees of completion) include/involve:

- CLI modding tools for video games (including a lot of reverse-engineering through Ghidra).
- Video game speedrunning autosplitters.
- Bit-level (de)serialisation library.
- SNES emulation, (dis)assembly and debug tooling.
  - I hope to one day write an entire one-stop-shop SNES dev environment.
- Human-theory pen-and-paper puzzle solvers.
- Automated scanning of file corruption (_extremely_ barebones and built just to meet my own specific usecase).
- File formats! All the file formats! Give me your file formats!
- The Win32 API.
- Discord bots.
- Web API for text-to-speech system.

I learn through immersion. I _will_ dive into your low-level libraries and enjoy myself. Please spare no details.

Here be ~~dragons~~ ponies.
